For the last few Decembers I've participated in the [Advent of code](adventofcode.com) and decided to do something a little different this year.

I'm going to read some of Knuth's TAOCP and blog about it.  It's been sitting on my shelf, I think since 2011 when my parents gave it to me as a MS graduation gift.  I got partway through volume 1 and I think some of the numerical algorithms when I got it, but otherwise it's just made me look like a computer scientist.

You can learn more about me at my ["professional" web site](www.cs.utah.edu/~benjones), on [Github](github.com/benjones) or on [twitter](twitter.com/1kterafile).
