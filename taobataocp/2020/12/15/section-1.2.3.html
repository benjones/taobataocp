<p>This section is about how to manipulate sums.  Knuth covers the standard rules: distributive law, change of variables, reordering sums, and splitting/joining the domain.</p>

<p>A couple of highlights were a formula for changing the relations (basiaclly an implicit definition of the sum’s domain) when you reorder the summations.  Basically sum_R(i) sum_S(i,j)  == sum_S’(j) sum_R’(i,j)  with S’(j) == there exists and i with S(i) &amp;&amp; R(i,j) and R’(i,j) == S(i) &amp;&amp; R(i,j).</p>

<p>The other highight was a indicator function notation that I hadn’t seen before: [p(x)] == p(x) ? 1 : 0.  Using this, the sums become sum_i(unbounded) a_i*[predicate(i)] so the the range is reperesented through a product.  Sort of nifty.</p>
