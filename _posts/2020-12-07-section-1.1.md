Knuth introduces the definition of an algorithm, which apparently wasn't a common term.  Apparently it was most commonly associated with Euclid's algorithm which is the case study for the chapter.  

Good quote: "An algorithm must be seen to be believed"

Knuth says you have to work out an algorithm with pen/paper to understand it, which jives pretty well with my experience.

The end of the chapter defines an algorithm in terms of a mathematical function that maps states of the program to each other.  I didn't really understand his last formulation which I guess comes from Markov?  The function inputs are string/number pairs, where the strings are a representation of the algorithm state, and the numbers I think the numbers represent what subset of the output state is produced in this step?

In any case, I don't see much utility for thinking of an algorithm that way and it seems like that part is written to convince mathematicians that this is a legitimate field of study :sjhrug:.
