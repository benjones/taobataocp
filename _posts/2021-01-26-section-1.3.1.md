Finally we get to MIX.  There's a note in my edition, which I think was from 1997, that MIX is woefully out of date and will be replaced by MMIX (2009) which will be a normal-seeming 64 bit machine.  Apparently a revised volume 1 came out in 2005 which uses MMIX.

The word format takes up a good chunk of the description with words being 5 "bytes" + a sign bit.  A "byte" stores numbers from 0 to something between  64 and 100.  You're not supposed to know the exact size of a byte and so doing operations on pieces of a word have to be performed very carefully.  It will be interesting to see how much advantage of this is taken later on to do weird data packings, etc.

The instructions are relatively normal with the exception of the addressing modes + weird word size.  There are 6 index registers which can be referenced as part of an instruction to add an offset to an address.  All instructions take a memory address, so I don't think there are actually any register/register operations.  I guess some of the rotate/shift instructions don't touch memory?

This chapter is definitely a reminder of how much has changed in 50 years, both in the design of MIX and the lack of standardization of real machines, and in the timing estimates (memory and compute take equal time).
