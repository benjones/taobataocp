This section talks about permutations.  The key parts are 2 algorithms for permutation composition (Knuth calls it multiplication).  One algorithm is pretty human-like with repeated scans over the input, and the other is single pass and more "machine like."  There's assembly code for both which has passing resemblance to modern assembly, and honestly seems to have little value.  There's really no need to examine code that has a loop to read input data from punch cards.

The analysis has a discussion of "kirchoff's law" for statements, which I think I mentioned before.  I think I also mentioned that doing precise counts of every instruction seems somewhat useless these days given that 1 cache miss will take more time than 100 instructions.  There are a couple of clever algorithms for computing inverse permutations which are unfotunately tricky to follow/understand.  The pseudocode for the algorithms is really hard to understand since because it's written in a prose with a goto style.

I should maybe chalk it up to being in a bad mood because I've been dealing with cheating students this evening, but I found myself more annoyed with how antiquated the presentation is than appreciative of the insights/ideas.  Also, I recognize the irony of being irritated by a book from the 1970s about computers being out of date.
