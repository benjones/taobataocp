This section is about generating functions which take a sequence and turn it into a function.  The most interesting nugget piece was talking about how it doesn't really matter if the generating function converges.  You use them as a tool to get some insight into understanding a sequence and once you have an idea what the answer should be (a closed form representatino or whatever), you can prove it another way (like by using induction).  I think the DEA must have read this chapter when they went all in on "parallel construction."

This is another section that I mostly zoned out for most of.
