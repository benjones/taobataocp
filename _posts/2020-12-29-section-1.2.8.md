This section is about Fibonacci numbers.  There's a long discussion of the relationship between Fibonacci numbers and Euclid's algorithm with a proof that gcd(F_m, F_n) = F_gcd(m_n) which is sort of interesting.

Then he uses a generating function to come up with a closed form formula for F_n using phi.  One piece that confused me was that he said "if G(z) exists" which I suppose means "assuming |z| < 1" so that G has a finite value.

In any case, I'm ready to be finished with all the mathematical preliminaries and get onto the MIX stuff.
