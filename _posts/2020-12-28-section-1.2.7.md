This section is about the harmonic numbers (sum_k 1/k).  There's an interesting formula for H_n which is natural log of n + some small fudge factor terms.  I remember proving that the harmonic series diverges by computing the integral of 1/x in calc class, but don't remember hearing the connection that H_n was very very close to ln(n).

The rest of the sections was some maniuplations of sums combining harmonic numbers with binomial coefficients... I lost interest and skimmed over it.
