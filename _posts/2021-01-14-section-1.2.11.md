This section is about big O notation.  It's more or less the standard intro you'd get in a ugrad algorithms class.  What's very interesting to me is that it's marked as a "skip the first time you read this" section because "it covers a rather specialized topic that is interesting but not essential."  I would say that big O analysis has since become essential.  Based on what I've read so far, and what I recall from the last time I read part of the book(s) is that the analysis is very exact and all coefficients and constants are carefully computed.  Given how unequal different operations are (a multiply vs a read from L2 cache vs a network round trip), it seems that counting operations is probably not worth the trouble in almost all cases.  It will be interesting to see how Big O is used throughout the book.
