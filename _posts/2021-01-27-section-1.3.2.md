This section is about MIX Assembly Language (MIXAL)... It seemed to age even worse to me than the MIX architecture.

I realized through an example in this section that the call stack wasn't a normal thing, or at least MIX doesn't have call/ret instructions.  On a jump, the PC +1 is stored in a special register, and the callee is responsible for overwriting the "return" instruction (just a plain old jump) to set it's address field to the caller's PC +1.  There's a name for this from a computerphile video I watched a while back, but can't remember it.  In any case, thank god for call, ret, and a standardized understanding of how a stack should work.

Perhaps part of the reason that I found this section to have aged so poorly is that there's a couple of pages devoted to how to write out MIXAL on a punch card.  I'm hoping the rest of the book focuses enough on the algorithms/analysis that the idosyncrasies of a fictional 50+ year old computer design don't weigh too heavily.
