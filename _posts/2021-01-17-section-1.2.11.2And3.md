The first subsection talks about an approximation due to Euler for computing sums using integrals.  The Bernulli polynomials/coefficients make an appearance here.  There's lots of integral and summation manipulation that takes place here.  I mostly skimmed this section.

The one interesting piece was that at one point, we have to come up for a formula for the mth derivative of f(x).  This seemed like a math example of a "higher order function" or metaprogramming or some other high-level functional abstraction.

The second subsection was some proofs and approximations related to a couple of series... I didn't even read through the whole section.  Next section is MIX, finally.
