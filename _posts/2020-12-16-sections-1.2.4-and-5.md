Section 1.2.4 is about some some basic number theory stuff.  It introduces floor/ceiling functinos and the laws of modular arithmetic.  The definition of modulo he uses is the one I like best where -1 % N == N - 1 which is most useful for array wraparound.

The modular arithmetic manipulation example is of Fermat's theorem which always sort of seemed like magic to me, but his proof (which I assume is a standard one) is very clear.

Section 1.2.5 is about factorials, and eventually the gamma function.  There's a great joke here abotu how Vaughan Pratt (who's that?) thinks permutations are so important that they should just be called "perms" which Knuth suggests would make textbooks shorter and cheaper.

He presents a couple of different approaches to inductively building permutations from permutations of subsets, one of which is kind of clever and uses fractional indices.  Basically you add a new value in some position with fractional indices between all the original indices, and then relabel the indices, sorted by value.

There's a lot of history about how Stirling and Eueler tried to extend the factorial function to the reals, which was interesting, but I don't think I've ever come across the gamma function in any sort of algorithm analysis, so I'm curious if it's actually going to get used, or if it was just a bit of history that Knuth was excited about.
