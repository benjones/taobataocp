This section is about binomial coefficients and their identities.  It's the longest section by far so far and my eyes glazed over.  There was one explanation of an identity that caught my attention:

r + s choose n means "choose n people from r men and s women" which is equal to sum_k r choose k * s choose n -k.  The right side is choose r of the men and s of the women.

It ends with a discussion of Stirling numbers which I don't think I've heard of, and wasn't interested in.
